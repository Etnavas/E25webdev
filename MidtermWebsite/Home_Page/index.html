      <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm currently a full time college student, and I've always been passsionated about making things.
       I decided to create this website so that I could have a place to compile some of the things that I've made, 
       that way I can keep track of them. instead of forgetting about them in a random folder somewhere in my computer lol.
       This is not necessarely a place to display my best work but just as a dumping ground for some of the projects and things 
       I've created. Feel free to look around :)
