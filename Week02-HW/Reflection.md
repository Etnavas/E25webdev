This article was very insightfull about the importance of wireframes and their role in the
process of designing a website. I find it very interesting how much importance there is on 
getting and applying feedback which is something that I never really thought about, and 
how many teams inputs are envolved in the process. My main take away is that it is 
important to keep in mind your intended audience when making a wireframe and equally it is
also very important to take in feedback and apply it when need it.
